To watch sass, enter this in the CL

(assuming sass has already been installed via npm)

sass --watch scss/style.scss:css/style.css

This says:  sass, please watch scss/style.scss and then OUTPUT it to css/style.css

When I do this the first time, I have made the css folder, but NOT the style.css file.
Sass will do this for me.
